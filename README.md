# Hexarena

A multiplayer free-for-all hex-strategy game with a deterministic Rust engine, fog-of-war views for humans and CPUs alike, a bot SDK, and a replay viewer. This repository is the foundation slice of the larger platform (arena, submission, self-play) described in `agents/ROADMAP.md`.

## Clean-room declaration

Hexarena is a standalone project. No source code, bots, model weights, replays, training data, experiment notes, configuration, or git history from Hexwar or any previous project was imported, copied, vendored, or adapted. Every implementation here was written from scratch. A visual reference screenshot informed only the general look (dark, board-first, restrained). No previous CPU names, ratings, or lineages are carried over. See [ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-clean-room.md).

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `crates/protocol` | Versioned public types: `View`, `Action`, terrain, buildings, `RulesConfig`, events, `MatchResult`, `Replay` |
| `crates/engine` | Pure deterministic engine: map generation, fog-filtered views, tick resolution, placement scoring, leaderboard metrics |
| `crates/arena` | Runs CPU matches on the engine and converts replays to the viewer format (shared by CLI and server) |
| `crates/server` | Axum game server: create games, store replays in `data/matches/`, serve viewer documents and the CPU leaderboard |
| `crates/cli` | `hexarena` CLI: `simulate`, `report`, `map`, `verify`, `export` |
| `sdk/rust` | Bot trait and the built-in CPU roster: Expander, Homesteader, Raider, Warden |
| `web` | React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui: start page (create games, game list, leaderboard) and replay viewer |
| `agents`, `migrations`, `deploy`, `trainer` | Coordination docs and reserved locations; see roadmap |

## Run it

```bash
cargo run --release -p hexarena-server       # game server on http://127.0.0.1:47240
cd web && pnpm install && pnpm dev           # start page on http://127.0.0.1:47231
```

Open the start page, pick 2 to 8 CPU seats, a length and an optional seed, and create one game or a batch of up to 20 (consecutive seeds). Games run in the background on the Rust engine; when one finishes, click **Watch**. The leaderboard aggregates every finished game by CPU style. Games persist in `data/matches/` (override with `HEXARENA_DATA`; port with `HEXARENA_PORT`). If the server isn't running, the start page says so and the bundled sample match still plays.

Server API: `GET /api/bots`, `GET|POST /api/matches` (`{"bots": ["raider", "warden"], "seed": 7, "max_ticks": 1500, "count": 5}`), `GET /api/matches/{id}`, `GET /api/matches/{id}/viewer`, `GET /api/matches/{id}/replay`, `GET /api/leaderboard`.

```bash
cargo test                                   # engine, scoring, fog-leak, arena determinism tests
cargo run --release -p hexarena-cli -- map --players 8 --seed 42
cargo run --release -p hexarena-cli -- simulate --bots expander,homesteader,raider,warden --seed 7 --out /tmp/r.json
cargo run --release -p hexarena-cli -- verify /tmp/r.json
cargo run --release -p hexarena-cli -- export /tmp/r.json web/public/sample-replay.json
```

A match ends when one player is left or at the tick limit (1500 ticks in Rules v0), where survivors are ranked by land, then troops. The viewer opens at `?tick=end` or `?tick=N`, and `?zoom=N` starts zoomed in. Viewer exports store delta-encoded frames (`frame_encoding: "delta-v2"`), which keeps a full 1500-tick match around 1 MB.

## Deploy

One container runs everything: `docker build -t hexarena . && docker run -p 8080:8080 -v hexarena-data:/data hexarena`. See [deploy/README.md](deploy/README.md) for Fly.io and bare-metal instructions.

## Rules summary (alpha-1, all numbers provisional)

All balance values live in `RulesConfig` (`crates/protocol`). Each owned traversable hex yields exactly 1 troop per tick. Defender strength is scaled by target height (valleys cheap, hills costly). One action per player per tick: `Pass`, `Move`, or `Build` (Farm, Village, Quarry, Wall). Farm-Village links, Wall defense, and Quarry resource income are provisional mechanics.

Vision is 3 hexes from owned territory. Terrain is public (config flag); ownership, troops, and buildings are fogged. `State::view` is the only information channel to a player; tests construct states that differ only outside vision and assert byte-identical serialized views.

## Placement scoring

`points = N - place + 1`; place is set by elimination order (simultaneous eliminations share the average). At the tick limit survivors are ranked by land, troops, resource, buildings; exact ties share. Normalized score is `(N - place) / (N - 1)`. `MatchResult` stores the full order, places, points, normalized scores, and survival ticks. `engine::scoring::Metrics` aggregates games, average points/place, win/top-4/top-half/last rates, distribution, and survival. Metrics are keyed by bot, rules version, lobby size, and ranked/experimental so they are never mixed.

## Not built yet

Postgres (games are JSON files for now), Wasmtime bot sandbox, uploads/quarantine, scheduled arena runs, a rating system beyond average placement, the trainer, and live human play. See `agents/ROADMAP.md`.
